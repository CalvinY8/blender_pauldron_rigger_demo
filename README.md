# blender_pauldron_rigger_demo
sample code in this repo.

full script demo:</br>
https://youtu.be/t3RXF5xSDVs

Terms:</br>
Blender - free 3d software</br>
clipping - when 3d geometry intersects, ex: character tries to move, shoulder pad passes through the torso. This is problematic.</br>
armature - skeleton that lets characters move</br>

Input:
specify a few fields, press start!</br>

Process:
doing simple math and physics calculations, and modifying the armature accordingly...</br>

Output:
The shoulder armor will now adjust position based on arm motion,</br>
reducing the need to fix clipping by hand (a tedious process)</br>


---features---</br>
works with A-pose, T-pose, any pose in-between</br>
works regardless of armature size</br>
works regardless of upper arm bone length relative to armature</br>

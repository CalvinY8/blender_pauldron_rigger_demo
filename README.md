# blender_pauldron_rigger_demo
sample code in this repo.

full script demo:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIUIZ8oavkg

Terms (loosely defined):
Blender - free 3d software
clipping - when 3d geometry intersects, ex: character tries to move, shoulder pad passes through the torso
armature - skeleton that lets characters move

Input:
specify a few fields, press start!

Process:
doing some simple math and physics calculations on the armature...

Output:
The shoulder armor will now adjust position based on arm motion,
reducing the need to fix clipping by hand (a tedious process)

---full script features---

#works with A-pose and T-pose
#works regardless of armature size or shoulder width
#works regardless of upper arm bone length
